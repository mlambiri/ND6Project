# State-of-the-art knowledge on human mitochondrial complex I structure and function

## Executive summary

Human mitochondrial complex I (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase) is now understood at near-atomic detail as a 45-subunit, ~1 MDa L‑shaped redox-driven proton pump, whose catalytic core is evolutionarily conserved yet embedded in a dense “cage” of mammalian supernumerary subunits that contribute stability, assembly and regulation. Multiple cryo‑EM studies since 2016 have resolved essentially complete mammalian complex I structures and, crucially, have separated and/or trapped distinct conformational and ligation states that map onto long-standing biochemical phenomena such as the active↔deactive transition. citeturn29view0turn31view0turn33view0

The most immediately relevant “human-specific” structural advance (as of Feb 2026) is a high-resolution cryo‑EM structure of native human complex I within a respirasome context at ~2.66 Å, with extensive side-chain definition and explicit modelling of cofactors and key post-translational modifications in the same dataset. citeturn5view3turn5view4 This substantially upgrades the interpretability of pathogenic human variants (nuclear- and mtDNA-encoded) in their authentic mammalian structural environment compared with earlier, lower-resolution human/supercomplex models and mammalian surrogates. citeturn5view3turn12search4

Mechanistically, the field has moved from “where are the subunits?” to a sharper question: **how does quinone chemistry in the peripheral arm couple to long-range proton pumping in the membrane arm?** Although the overall electron-transfer chain (NADH → FMN → Fe‑S clusters → quinone) is structurally well defined, linking the energetics of quinone reduction/oxidation to **four** pumped protons remains contested. Competing models differ on whether (and how) global “open/closed” motions are catalytic intermediates versus off-cycle resting states, how many discrete quinone binding positions/sites are functionally relevant, and how electrostatics versus conformational gating propagates through the membrane arm’s conserved charged networks and hydration pathways. citeturn8search7turn11view5turn7view1turn25search4

Functionally and medically, two developments stand out. First, high-resolution mammalian structures in lipidic environments with ubiquinone-10 occupancy show substantial **state-dependent plasticity** in the Q-site loops and local proton pathways, supporting the idea that subtle ordering/disordering and hydration changes are central to regulation and possibly coupling. citeturn6view3turn36view0turn7view1 Second, structural work on disease-linked mammalian variants ties clinically relevant phenotypes to either (i) destabilised/paused assembly (e.g., late-stage factors and paralogue swaps) or (ii) “deactivating” shifts that selectively suppress reverse electron transfer (RET)–linked ROS production, with direct implications for ischaemia–reperfusion injury. citeturn35view0turn12search2turn26search2

**Important note about the “four user-provided PMC articles.”** The prompt indicates four PMC links were “given”, but no links were actually present in the message I received. I therefore proceeded using widely cited PMC-available primary articles and reviews that match your criteria (high-resolution cryo‑EM, biochemical definition of states, assembly/disease structure–function), and I explicitly flag these in the scored reference section so you can swap in your intended four once you provide them. citeturn29view0turn31view0turn33view0turn35view0

## Structural advances

Complex I structural biology since 2016 can be viewed as four converging streams: (a) completeness of the subunit inventory and architecture, (b) resolution sufficient to model cofactors, waters and local networks, (c) structural definition of physiologically relevant conformational states (active/deactive and beyond), and (d) embedding complex I in native higher-order organisations (respirasomes/megacomplexes) to approach the human physiological context. citeturn29view0turn5view3turn7view1turn11view5

### Subunit composition, modular architecture, and cofactors

A complete mammalian complex I comprises **45 subunits**: **14 “core”** subunits conserved from bacteria (housing the catalytic machinery) plus **31 supernumerary** subunits that are largely eukaryote- and lineage-specific. A complete bovine model at ~4.2 Å provided the first near-complete localisation/modelling of essentially all subunits and established how supernumerary subunits create an enclosing “cage” around the core, particularly in the membrane arm. citeturn29view0turn30view3

The catalytic core contains **nine redox cofactors** (FMN plus Fe–S clusters) arranged to support long-range electron transfer to the Q-site near the membrane interface. citeturn29view0turn25search3 In later high-resolution mammalian structures, nucleotides bound to specific supernumerary subunits became directly observable (e.g., a nucleotide in a nucleoside-kinase-homology subunit) and additional cofactors/lipids are modelled with increasing confidence. citeturn31view0turn32view4turn29view0

### Conformational states and definable structural “signatures”

A central structural–functional theme is the **active↔deactive transition**, a long-known biochemical phenomenon in mammalian complex I. Cryo‑EM classification initially revealed multiple particle classes with subtle domain rearrangements and local disordering; later work using **biochemically defined** preparations confirmed one class corresponds to the **deactive** state characterised by localised unfolding/disorder around the quinone-binding region. citeturn30view4turn33view0turn34view0

Key repeated “signatures” of the deactive/open-like state across mammalian datasets include:
- Disorder/absence of structural elements that shape the Q-binding region (notably loops contributed by multiple subunits at the peripheral/membrane interface), consistent with the deactive state being catalytically dormant until reactivated. citeturn34view0turn30view4turn32view4  
- State-dependent helix distortions (π‑bulges) and local rearrangements in the membrane domain, including elements that influence conserved charged networks relevant to proton translocation. citeturn31view0turn32view4turn6view3

These structural signatures now provide a common vocabulary for integrating otherwise heterogeneous cryo‑EM datasets and for testing whether a resolved conformation is likely catalytic, resting/ready, dormant/deactive, or partially destabilised. citeturn8search7turn31view0turn33view0

### Q-site occupancy, quinone binding positions, and lipidic environments

Two recent mammalian cryo‑EM lines have sharpened Q-site questions: (i) structures resolved under multiple substrate/inhibitor conditions with extensive structural catalogues, and (ii) nanodisc/bilayer studies that explicitly model ubiquinone-10 occupancy while reducing detergent artefacts.

A high-resolution bovine nanodisc study reports multiple well-resolved resting/ligand-bound and apo substates at **up to ~2.3 Å**, including a model with a ubiquinone-10 molecule occupying the full length of the Q-binding channel in an active resting state, and distinct ligand-bound/apo forms of the deactive state. citeturn7view1turn6view3turn36view0 The same work explicitly documents characteristic disorder and structural motifs in the deactive state (including membrane-helix features and Q-site loop behaviour), and maps how ligand occupancy reshapes local cavities and proposed proton pathways. citeturn6view3turn6view4turn7view1

A separate porcine cryo‑EM study provides multiple datasets/conditions and argues that Q10 can occupy multiple positions in a narrow “Q chamber” with several discrete binding sites, reporting structures classified into active and deactive biochemical classes across conditions at ~2.4–3.5 Å. citeturn11view5turn11view3turn11view1 Together, these studies elevate quinone positioning from a static “one-site” view to a dynamic, state- and chemistry-dependent ensemble, with direct consequences for coupling models. citeturn11view5turn7view1turn25search4

### Assembly factors and late-stage maturation intermediates

Structural biology is increasingly being applied to **assembly** rather than only the mature enzyme. A disease-model study of a late subunit loss (a common Leigh syndrome-linked nuclear gene) shows that near-complete assembly intermediates can accumulate in vivo, with heterogenous classes that include either an assembly factor or a late core-associated subunit, and with a critical paralogue replacement step failing (an assembly-factor paralogue is present while the mature paralogue is absent). citeturn35view0

In that dataset, the NADH-dehydrogenase “N-module” is only loosely associated, providing a structural rationale for the reduced stability/activity and for the characteristic appearance of subcomplexes in biochemical assays. citeturn35view0 This is a particularly important conceptual shift: many “complex I deficiencies” are not straightforward catalytic-site lesions but **maturation bottlenecks** that lock the system into quasi-mature states with altered module attachment and altered regulatory factor occupancy. citeturn35view0turn12search4

### Human structural context: high-resolution human complex I within a respirasome

A 2026 cryo‑EM analysis of native human respirasome species reports a human complex I map and model at ~2.66 Å (within the larger assembly), enabling detailed side-chain interpretation, explicit cofactor modelling and identification of specific modifications in the same structural context. citeturn5view3turn5view4 This matters because many mechanistic and disease inferences have historically relied on bovine/porcine/mouse surrogates; the new human-respirasome-resolution regime reduces uncertainty in mapping human variants, especially where supernumerary subunits and interfaces differ subtly among mammals. citeturn5view3turn12search4

## Functional mechanisms

### Electron transfer: from NADH to ubiquinone

At the broad level, electron transfer in complex I is structurally the “cleanest” part of the mechanism: NADH reduces FMN, then electrons traverse a chain of Fe–S clusters whose organisation and spacing are consistent with long-range tunnelling, ending at the terminal cluster (N2) proximal to the quinone reduction site. citeturn25search3turn29view0turn31view0 The experimental definition of Fe–S cluster organisation in a bacterial complex I peripheral arm provided a blueprint later mapped onto mitochondrial enzymes (with additional supernumerary context in mammals). citeturn25search3turn29view0

What has become more nuanced is **how the Q-site behaves**: high-resolution mammalian structures show that the Q-binding channel and its gating loops are not rigid, and that occupancy by Q10 or detergent-like ligands correlates with distinct loop and cavity conformations across resting and deactive classes. citeturn6view3turn36view0turn34view0 This supports mechanistic pictures in which quinone chemistry and local proton availability depend on state-dependent ordering, hydration and electrostatics near the Q chamber, rather than a single static binding pocket. citeturn7view1turn11view5turn8search7

### Proton pumping: established stoichiometry, debated molecular implementation

The consensus stoichiometry in mammalian complex I is **four protons pumped per NADH oxidised** (per two electrons transferred), supported by direct kinetic/stoichiometric measurements in mammalian systems and comparative analysis with bacterial models. citeturn26search1turn26search3 The precise pathways and coupling elements that implement this “4H+ per 2e–” output remain the central open problem, although high-resolution structures increasingly constrain plausible models. citeturn7view1turn11view5turn25search4

Structurally, the membrane arm contains antiporter-like subunits with conserved architecture, helix discontinuities and conserved ionisable residues forming long chains/networks through the membrane domain. citeturn25search2turn31view0turn30view4 These features appear positioned to support coupled protonation-state changes and gated hydration (“proton wires”) that could enable vectorial proton transfer. citeturn6view3turn36view2turn25search4

### Coupling models: conformational gating vs electrostatic propagation

Recent mammalian cryo‑EM has amplified (rather than eliminated) a core controversy: **are the major global conformations (“open/closed”, “active/deactive-like”) on-cycle catalytic intermediates or off-cycle resting/regulatory states?** A focused review explicitly frames this debate and argues that, absent tight biochemical characterisation of the structural samples, assigning catalytic roles to conformations is risky; it highlights the need to unify kinetics, redox conditions and structure in a single framework. citeturn8search7

On the other hand, a high-impact mammalian cryo‑EM study in 2020 proposed that dramatic conformational changes around the quinone cavity couple redox chemistry to proton translocation during open↔closed transitions, combining conformational and electrostatic components in a single mechanism. citeturn25search4turn25search12 A later multi-condition porcine study explicitly claims to overturn a previously accepted view of coupling, using a large state catalogue and multi-position quinone binding observations to argue that how/where coupling occurs may differ from earlier assumptions. citeturn11view5turn11view3

A key structural point underlying essentially all coupling hypotheses is that the “energy transduction interface” sits at the junction between the peripheral arm Q chemistry and a membrane-arm network (“E-channel” and adjacent residue chains) that can transmit changes in electrostatics and hydration across long distances. Local ordering/disordering of Q-site loops in the deactive versus active resting states plausibly gates not only substrate access but also proton availability and hydrogen-bond networks that could seed long-range propagation. citeturn30view4turn34view0turn6view3

### Regulation by deactivation and physiological stress

The deactive state is now structurally defined as a dormant state with local unfolding/disorder around the Q-binding region that prevents normal catalysis until slow reactivation occurs in the presence of substrates. citeturn34view0turn30view4turn32view4 This aligns with biochemical observations that deactivation forms under conditions where turnover is limited (such as low oxygen) and is implicated in the physiological response to ischaemia/reperfusion (IR) injury. citeturn33view0turn26search2

A key pathophysiological axis is succinate accumulation under ischaemia and rapid oxidation upon reperfusion, driving RET at complex I and producing damaging ROS. citeturn26search2 The deactive state is widely discussed as protective in this context because it suppresses (or strongly limits) RET-driven ROS bursts until reactivation proceeds. Structural datasets explicitly connect deactive-associated Q-site loop disorder and membrane-helix motifs to this regulatory logic. citeturn33view0turn12search2turn30view4

### Disease-linked mutations: catalytic lesions vs assembly/maturation defects

A major conceptual advance is that many human complex I disorders arise not only from direct catalytic-site lesions but also from **assembly and maturation defects**, especially involving late-stage subunits and paralogue swaps. A structural study of a Leigh syndrome-linked mouse model lacking a late subunit shows that complex I accumulates in heterogeneous near-complete states where the NADH-dehydrogenase module is loosely associated and where an assembly factor is present in discrete classes; importantly, a mature paralogue that normally replaces that assembly factor is absent, blocking maturation. citeturn35view0

Conversely, certain mtDNA-encoded mutations cause subtle but functionally decisive shifts in the membrane domain that bias the enzyme toward a deactive-like behaviour, selectively abolishing RET-linked ROS production with comparatively mild baseline phenotypes, illustrating that “regulatory deactivation tuning” is itself a disease-relevant dimension of complex I biology. citeturn12search2turn35view0

### Disease-associated mutation table (representative, structure-informed)

The table below is deliberately selective: it prioritises variants that are (i) structurally mapped in modern mammalian contexts and/or (ii) mechanistically interpretable in terms of Q-site gating, module stability, or RET/ROS regulation, consistent with your “high-value” criterion.

**Interpretation caution:** Complex I has hundreds of reported pathogenic variants. Comprehensive enumeration requires dedicated clinical databases (outside your “peer‑reviewed only” constraint), so the table emphasises *mechanistically interpretable exemplars* grounded in modern cryo‑EM and disease-model primary literature. citeturn12search4turn35view0turn12search2

## Comparison to non-human and bacterial complex I

### What mammals add: supernumerary subunits, expanded regulation, and deactivation

Bacterial complex I (often called NDH‑1) is closer to the 14‑subunit catalytic core, lacking the extensive supernumerary cohort that in mammals forms a structural cage and creates additional interfaces for lipids, assembly factors and regulatory elements. The 2016 mammalian structure shows how this cage encloses and stabilises the core, especially around the membrane arm, and highlights mitochondria-specific domains such as CHCH-containing subunits on the intermembrane-space face. citeturn29view0

The mammalian **active↔deactive** transition is also much more prominent physiologically than in many bacterial systems, and mammalian structures explicitly tie deactivation to local loop disordering at the Q-site and to state-dependent membrane-helix motifs. citeturn34view0turn32view4turn36view0 This regulatory layer is directly implicated in ischaemia/reperfusion biology and in disease-linked “deactivating” variants. citeturn26search2turn12search2

### Conserved membrane-arm architecture: antiporter-like subunits and long-range coupling potential

A key conserved insight from bacterial structural work is that the membrane domain contains antiporter-like subunits with unusual inverted-repeat architecture and discontinuous helices that plausibly form channels or half-channels across the membrane. citeturn25search2 This architecture underpins the modern view that long-range proton pumping is executed by conserved membrane-domain modules whose residue networks and hydration behaviour are modulated from the Q-site region. Mammalian cryo‑EM now overlays supernumerary stabilisation and regulation onto this conserved “engine.” citeturn31view0turn6view3turn29view0

### Conserved electron-transfer chain: bacterial definitions as a mechanistic template

The organisation of Fe–S clusters in the bacterial hydrophilic domain established the physical framework for electron transfer, including spacing consistent with electron tunnelling along the chain. citeturn25search3 Mammalian structures preserve this chain while embedding it in additional context and, at higher resolutions, support explicit discussions about proton availability and hydrogen-bond networks in and around the Q-site. citeturn29view0turn36view0

## Gaps, controversies, and open questions

Despite the explosion of high-resolution structures, **the coupling mechanism is not settled**. The strongest open issues can be framed as experimentally testable “gaps” rather than vague unknowns:

**Are global open/closed conformations catalytic intermediates or resting/regulatory states?**  
The same structural descriptors have been used to argue both ways. Reviews highlight that many cryo‑EM datasets lack the biochemical definition needed to assign catalytic roles, while other primary work proposes explicit coupling via open↔closed transitions. Resolving this likely requires time-resolved or turnover‑trapped cryo‑EM coupled to rigorous kinetic state assignments in the same preparation. citeturn8search7turn25search4turn36view0

**How many quinone binding sites/poses are functionally relevant, and which step couples to pumping?**  
Modern mammalian studies report Q10 in multiple positions and propose multi-site “chambers,” but it remains unclear which poses are on-pathway during energy conversion, which are resting/parking positions, and how detergent or lipid environment shifts the ensemble. Detailed nanodisc work supports multi-state plasticity, and multi-condition porcine catalogues propose multiple binding sites; integrating these into a single catalytic trajectory remains unresolved. citeturn36view0turn11view5turn7view1

**What are the proton loading sites and how does hydration gate directionality?**  
Near-atomic structures enable explicit modelling of cavities and water molecules (and thus plausible proton wires), but the causal chain from Q-site redox to membrane-arm proton ejection is still inferred rather than directly observed. Competing models weight electrostatic coupling versus conformational gating differently, and the field lacks a decisive experimental discriminator that can resolve protonation dynamics in situ. citeturn36view2turn25search4turn25search2

**How do supernumerary subunits and supercomplex interfaces influence mechanism?**  
Supernumerary elements clearly stabilise the machine and create additional interfaces (including lipid-binding and cross-complex contacts in respirasomes), but their mechanistic role in coupling and regulation is not well quantified. The new high-resolution human respirasome-context structure provides a better platform to test interface-linked hypotheses, but functional experiments that specifically perturb these interfaces while preserving assembly are still sparse. citeturn5view3turn29view0turn31view0

**Disease interpretation challenge: catalytic defect vs assembly bottleneck vs regulatory rewiring**  
Disease studies increasingly show that some “complex I deficiencies” result from stalled maturation and altered module attachment rather than direct catalytic lesions; others tune the active/deactive equilibrium and selectively affect RET/ROS. A unifying, structure-guided classification of pathogenic mechanisms (and corresponding therapeutic entry points) remains an open translational need. citeturn35view0turn12search2turn12search4

This abstraction highlights the assembly insight from disease-model cryo‑EM: the persistence of an assembly-factor paralogue where a mature paralogue should appear can mark a stalled maturation state with functional consequences. citeturn35view0

## High-value primary references and scored bibliography

### Scoring criteria (1–10 value score)

Each unique reference cited in this report is scored using the following explicit criteria (max 10):

- **Primary evidence weight (0–4):** 4 = high-resolution cryo‑EM / rigorous structure–function primary study; 3 = strong biochemical/biophysical primary work; 2 = mixed/older or indirect primary; 1 = review/opinion without unique new data.
- **Human/mammalian relevance (0–2):** 2 = human; 1 = mammalian surrogate (bovine/mouse/pig/ovine); 0 = non-mammalian (still may be essential mechanistically).
- **Mechanistic leverage (0–2):** 2 = directly constrains coupling/deactivation/Q-site/proton pathways; 1 = supportive context; 0 = peripheral.
- **Recency and field influence (0–2):** 2 = 2021–2026 and/or clearly field-shaping; 1 = 2015–2020; 0 = seminal older work.
